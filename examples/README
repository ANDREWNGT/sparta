DSMC example problems

Each of these sub-directories contains a sample problem you can run
with DSMC.  They should all run quickly in a few seconds on a desktop
machine.  Each problem has an input script (in.*) and produces a log
file (log.*).  Some produce dump files (dump.*) when they run.

A few sample log file outputs on different machines and different
numbers of processors are included in the directories to compare your
answers to.  E.g. a log file like log.test.date.foo.P means it ran on
P processors of machine "foo" with the dated version of DSMC.  Note
that these problems should get statistically similar answers when run
on different machines or different numbers of processors, but not
identical answers to those in the log of dump files included here.

These are the sample problems in the various sub-directories:

Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:

cd foo
cp ../../src/dsmc_linux .          # copy DSMC executable to this dir
spk_dsmc < in.foo                  # run the problem

Running the simulation produces the files dump.foo and log.dsmc.
