<H3>collisions command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>collisions style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>none</I> or <I>vss</I> 

<LI>args = arguments for that style 

<PRE>  none args = none
  vss args = file mix-ID
    file = filename that lists species with their VSS model parameters
    mix-ID = ID of mixture to use for group definitions 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>collisions none
collisions vss all.vss background 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define what style of collisions will be performed by DSMC.  If
collisions are performed, particles are sorted by grid cell every
timestep and the appropriate collision model is invoked on a
per-grid-cell basis.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> style means that no collisions will be performed, i.e. free
molecular flow.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>vss</I> style is the Variable Soft Sphere model.  
</P>
<P>NOTE: VSS model needs to be described and cited.
</P>
<P>The <I>vss</I> style requires a <I>file</I> be specified which contains
definitions of VSS model parameters for some number of species, not
all of which may be in use by this simulation.  Only species currently
defined by the simulation simulation will be extracted from the file
and they must be present in the file.
</P>
<P>The format of the file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines are
allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.  All
other lines must have format like this with values separated by
whitespace:
</P>
<P>species-ID prop1 prop2 prop3 prop4
</P>
<P>The species-ID is a string that will be matched against the species
list used by the simulation, as described above.  The properties are
as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>prop1 = diam = diamter of particle (distance units)
<LI>prop2 = omega = ???
<LI>prop3 = tref = reference temperature (temperature units)
<LI>prop4 = alpha = ??? 
</UL>
<P>NOTE: give correct definitions and their units
</P>
<P>The <I>vss</I> style also requires a mixture ID to be specified which must
contain all the species defined for the simulation.  The group
definitions in the mixture will be used to perform collisions between
various pairs of groups.
