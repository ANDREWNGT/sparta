stats_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

stats_style arg1 arg2 ... :pre

arg1,arg2,... = list of statistical attributes :ulb,l
  possible attributes = step, elapsed, dt, cpu, tpcpu, spcpu,
                        npart, temp, 
                        vol, lx, ly, lz, xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo, zhi,

      step = timestep
      elapsed = timesteps since start of this run
      dt = timestep size
      cpu = elapsed CPU time in seconds
      tpcpu = time per CPU second
      spcpu = timesteps per CPU second
      npart = # of particles
      temp = temperature
      vol = volume of simulation box
      lx,ly,lz = simulation box lengths
      xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,zlo,zhi = box boundaries :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

stats_style step cpu npart temp
stats_style step temp cpu spcpu npart xlo xhi :pre

[Description:]

Set the content of statistical data printed to the screen and log
file.

The values printed by the various keywords are instantaneous values,
calculated on the current timestep.

Options invoked by the "stats_modify"_thermo_modify.html command can
be used to set the numeric precision of each printed value, as well as
other attributes of the statistics.

The {step} and {elapsed} keywords refer to timestep count.  {Step} is
the current timestep, or iteration count when a
"minimization"_minimize.html is being performed.  {Elapsed} is the
number of timesteps elapsed since the beginning of this run.

The {cpu} keyword is elapsed CPU seconds since the beginning of this
run.  The {tpcpu} and {spcpu} keywords are measures of how fast your
simulation is currently running.  The {tpcpu} keyword is simulation
time per CPU second, where simulation time is in time
"units"_units.html.  The {spcpu} keyword is the number of timesteps
per CPU second.  Both quantities are on-the-fly metrics, measured
relative to the last time they were invoked.  Thus if you are printing
out statistical output every 100 timesteps, the two keywords will
continually output the time and timestep rate for the last 100 steps.
