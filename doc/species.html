<H3>species command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species file ID1 ID2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>file = filename that lists species
<LI>ID1, ID2, ... = one or more species names listed in file
<LI>multi-species abbreviations can also be used (see below) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species species.data air
species species.data air Cl
species species.data O2 N2 NO
species myfile H+ Cl- HCl 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define one or more particle species to use in the simulation.  This
command can be used as many times as desired to add species to an
internal list of species that the simulation recognizes and has
parameters for.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>file</I> is the name of a file containing definitions for
some number of species, not all of which need to used by this
simulation.  Only those requested by ID will be extracted from the
file and they must be present in the file.  The format of the species
file is discussed below.
</P>
<P>Each <I>ID</I> is a character string used to identify the species, such as
N or O2 or NO or D or Fe-, which can be any combination of
alphanumeric characters, or "=", "-", or underscore.
</P>
<P>Instead of listing single-species IDs, one of several pre-defined
multi-species names can be used, each of which expands into a list of
several individual species IDs.  The list of recognized
abbreviations is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>air = N, O, NO 
</UL>
<P>These abbreviations can be used in combination with single-species IDs
as in the 2nd example above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The format of the species file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines
are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.
All other lines must have format like this with values separated
by whitespace:
</P>
<P>species-ID prop1 prop2 ... prop9
</P>
<P>The species-ID is a string that will be matched against the requested
species-ID, as described above.  The properties are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>prop1 = molwt = molecular weight
<LI>prop2 = mass = mass (mass units)
<LI>prop3 = rotdof = rotational degrees of freedom
<LI>prop4 = rotrel = rotational ???
<LI>prop5 = vibdof = vibrational degrees of freedom
<LI>prop6 = vibrel = vibrational ??
<LI>prop7 = vibtemp = vibrational temperature (temperature units)
<LI>prop8 = specwt = ???
<LI>prop9 = charge = ??? 
</UL>
<P>NOTE: give correct definitions and their units
</P>
