<H3>species command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species file ID1 ID2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>file = filename that lists species
<LI>ID1, ID2, ... = one or more species names listed in file
<LI>multi-species abbreviations can also be used (see below) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species species.data air
species species.data air Cl
species species.data O2 N2 NO
species myfile H+ Cl- HCl 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define one or more particle species to use in subsequent simulations.
This command can be used as many times as desired to add species to a
list of species that the simulation recognizes and has parameters for.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> is a file that contains definitions for some number of
species, not all of which need be used in a simulation.  Only those
requested with specific IDs must be present in the file.  The format
of the species file is discussed below.
</P>
<P>Each <I>ID</I> is a character string used to identify the species, such as
N or O2 or NO or D or Fe-, which can be any combination of
alphanumeric characters, or "=", "-", or underscore.
</P>
<P>Instead of listing single-species IDs, one of several pre-defined
multi-species names can be used, each of which expands into a list of
several individual species IDs:
</P>
<UL><LI>air = N, O, NO 
<LI>air++ = N, O, NO, e-
<LI>etc 
</UL>
<P>These abbreviations can be used in combination with single-species IDs
as in the 2nd example above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The format of the species file depends on the particle style.  In each
case, comment or blank lines are allowed in the file.  Comment lines
start with a "#" character.  All other lines must have a whitespace
separated format like this:
</P>
<P>species-ID prop1 prop2 prop3 ... propN
</P>
<P>The species-ID is a string that matches the requests species-ID, as
described above.  The N property values are the set of values defined
by the particle style.  The file is searched for a line with a
species-ID that matches the requested ID used in the species command,
and its properties are extracted.
</P>
<P>The list of properties defined in a species file for each particle
style are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>standard = molwt, molmass, diam, rotdof, rotrel, vibdof, vibrel, vibtemp, specwt, charge, omega, tref, alpha 
</UL>
<P>We should define what these mean and their units.
</P>
<P>We can add more of these definititions over time.
