<PRE>collide style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>none</I> or <I>vss</I> 

<LI>args = arguments for that style 

<PRE>  <I>none</I> args = none
  <I>vss</I> args = mix-ID file
    mix-ID = ID of mixture to use for group definitions
    file = filename that lists species with their VSS model parameters

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define what style of particle-particle collisions will be performed by
SPARTA each timestep.  If collisions are performed, particles are
sorted into grid cells every timestep and the appropriate collision
model is invoked on a per-grid-cell basis.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> style means that no particle-particle collisions will be
performed, i.e. the simulation models free-molecular flow.
</P>
<HR>

<P>A molecular interaction must be specified for a collisional DSMC 
calcualtion.
</P>
<P>The <I>vss</I> style is the Variable Soft Sphere model.
</P>
<P>In DSMC simulations, the variable-soft-sphere (VSS) interaction of 
Koura and Matsumoto and the variable-hard-sphere (VHS) interaction 
of Bird are used to approximate molecular interactions.
Both these interactions yield transport properties proportional 
to a power (omega) of the gas temperature. This temperature 
 dependence of the trasnport properties is similar to the one of 
the Inverse Power Law model (IPL) for which Chapman-Enskog theory 
provides closed form solutions for the trainsport properties.
</P>
<P>The VSS and VHS interactions use a molecular diameter (d) which is 
a function of the molecular speed, a the angular-scattering parameter,
 which relates the scattering angle to the impact parameter. 
Since a = 1 produces isotropic (Hard Sphere) interactions this 
value can be used for the VSS model to reproduce the VHS model.  
</P>
<P>The <I>mix-ID</I> argument is a mixture ID which must contain all the
species defined for use by the simulation.  The group definitions in
the mixture will be used to perform collisions between pairs of
groups.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> argument is for a file which contains definitions of VSS
model parameters for some number of species.  It can contain species
not used by this simulation.  All species currently defined by the
simulation must be present in the file.
</P>
<P>The format of the file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines are
allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.  All
other lines must have the following format with values separated by
whitespace:
</P>
<P>species-ID prop1 prop2 prop3 prop4
</P>
<P>The species-ID is a string that will be matched against one of the
species defined by the simulation, via the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A>
command.  The properties are as follows:
</P>
<P>The methodolgy to calculate the values for the  VSS/VHS parameters 
is given in Chapter 3 of Bird 1994. Values for the most common gases are
also given in Appendix A of Bird 1994. These values are based on the
first order approximation of the Chapman-Enskog theory. The infinite-
order parameters are given by Gallis et al.
