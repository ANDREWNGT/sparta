fix grid/check command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID grid/check N :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
grid/check = style name of this fix command
N = check every N timesteps :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 grid/check 100 :pre

[Description:]

Check if particles are inside the grid cell they are supposed to be,
based on their current coordinates.  This is useful as a debugging
check to insure that no particles have been assigned to the incorrect
grid cell during the particle move stage of the DSMC algorithm.

The check is performed every {N} timesteps.  Particles not inside the
correct grid cell are counted and the value of the count can be
monitored (see below).  A value of 0 is "correct", meaning that no
particle was found to be outside its assigned grid cell.

[Restart, fix_modify, output:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
"output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  The scalar is the
count of how many particles were not in the correct grid cell.  The
count is cummulative over all the timesteps the check was performed
since the start of the run.  It is initialized to zero each time a run
is performed.

[Restrictions:] none
