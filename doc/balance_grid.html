<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command adjusts the assignment of grid cells and their particles
to processors, to attempt to balance the computational cost (load)
evenly across processors.  The load balancing is "static" in the sense
that this command performs the balancing once, before or between
simulations. The assignments will then remain static during the
subsequent run.  To perform "dynamic" balancing, see the <A HREF = "fix_balance.html">fix
balance</A> command, which can adjust the assignemt of
grid cells to processors on-the-fly during a run.
</P>
<P>After grid cells have been assigned, they are migrated to new owning
processors, along with any particles they own or other per-cell
attributes stored by fixes.  The internal data structures within
SPPARKS for grid cells and particles are re-initialized with the new
decomposition.
</P>
<P>This command is useful to use immediately after the grid is created,
via the <A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A> command, to partition the grid
in a more desirable manner than the default creation allows for.
</P>
<P>It is also useful to use once molecules have been created, or a
simulation has come to equilibrium with a spatially varying molecule
distribution, so that the computational load can be more evenly
balanced across processors.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>stride</I> keyword means that every Pth cell is assigned to the same
processor, where P is the number of processors.  E.g. if there are 100
cells and 10 processors, then the 1st processor (proc 0) will be
assigned cells 1,11,21, ..., 91.  The 2nd processor (proc 1) will be
assigned cells 2,12,22 ..., 92.  The 10th processor (proc 9) will be
assigned cells 10,20,30, ..., 100.
</P>
<P>The <I>clump</I> keyword means that the Pth clump of cells is assigned to
the same processor, where P is the number of processors.  E.g. if
there are N = 100 cells and 10 processors, then the 1st processor
(proc 0) will be assigned cells 1 to 10.  The 2nd processor (proc 1)
will be assigned cells 11 to 20.  And The 10th processor (proc 9) will
be assigned cells 91 to 100.
</P>
<P>The argument for <I>stride</I> and <I>clump</I> determines how the N grid cells
are ordered and is some permutation of <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>.  Each of the
N cells has 3 indices (I,J,K) to describe its location in the 3d grid.
If the stride argument is yxz, then the cells will be ordered from 1
to N with the y dimension (J index) varying fastest, the x dimension
next (I index), and the z dimension slowest (K index).
</P>
<P>The <I>block</I> keyword maps the P processors to a <I>Px</I> by <I>Py</I> by <I>Pz</I>
logical grid that overlays the actual <I>Nx</I> by <I>Ny</I> by <I>Nz</I> grid.  This
effectively assigns a contiguous 3d sub-block of cells to each
processor.
</P>
<P>Any of the <I>Px</I>, <I>Py</I>, <I>Pz</I> parameters can be specified with an
asterisk "*", in which case SPARTA will choose the number of processors
in that dimension.  It will do this based on the size and shape of the
global grid so as to minimize the surface-to-volume ratio of each
processor's sub-block of cells.
</P>
<P>The product of Px, Py, Pz must equal P, the total # of processors SPARTA
is running on.  For a 2d simulation, Pz must equal 1. If multiple
partitions are being used then P is the number of processors in this
partition; see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">this section</A> for an
explanation of the -partition command-line switch.
</P>
<P>Note that if you run on a large, prime number of processors P, then a
grid such as 1 x P x 1 will be required, which may incur extra
communication costs.
</P>
<P>The <I>random</I> keyword means that each grid cell will be assigned
randomly to one of the processors.  Note that in this case every
processor will typically not be assigned exactly the same number of
cells.
</P>
<P>The <I>proc</I> keyword means that each processor will choose a random
processor to assign its first grid cell to.  It will then loop over
its grid cells and assign each to consecutive processors, wrapping
around the collection of processors if necessary.  Note that in this
case every processor will typically not be assigned exactly the same
number of cells.
</P>
<P>The <I>rcb</I> keyword uses a recurvise coordinate bisectioning (RCB)
algorithm to assign spatially-compact clumps of grid cells to
processors.  Each grid cell has a "weight" in this algorithm so that
eacn processor is assigned an equal total weight of grid cells, as
nearly as possible.  If the <I>weight</I> argument is specified as <I>cell</I>,
than the weight for each grid cell is 1.0, so that each processor will
end up with an equal number of grid cells.  If the <I>weight</I> argument
is specified as <I>mol</I>, than the weight for each grid cell is the
number of molecules it currently owns, so that each processor will end
up with an equal number of molecules.
</P>
<P>Here are 2 example pictures, for a 2d simulation, of the partioning
provided by the RCB algorithm for a simulation on P processors of
100x100 or 10000 grid cells.  The one on the left is for an initially
uniform distribution of particles.  The one on the right is at a later
time when the particle density is larger on the right side of the
simulation box.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used after the grid has been created by the
<A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>This command also initializes various options in SPARTA before
performing the balancing.  This is so that grid cells are ready to
migrate to new processors.  Thus is you get an error like a simulation
box boundary condition has not been assigned, you will need to do that
operation in your input script before balancing can be performed.
