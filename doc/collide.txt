collide command :h3

[Syntax:]

collide style args :pre

style = {none} or {vss} :ulb,l
args = arguments for that style :l
  {none} args = none
  {vss} args = mix-ID file
    mix-ID = ID of mixture to use for group definitions
    file = filename that lists species with their VSS model parameters :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

collide none
collide vss all.vss background :pre

[Description:]

Define what style of particle-particle collisions will be performed by
SPARTA each timestep.  If collisions are performed, particles are
sorted into grid cells every timestep and the appropriate collision
model is invoked on a per-grid-cell basis.

The {none} style means that no particle-particle collisions will be
performed, i.e. the simulation models free-molecular flow.

:line

The {vss} style is the Variable Soft Sphere model.

NOTE: VSS model needs to be described and cited.

The {mix-ID} argument is a mixture ID which must contain all the
species defined for use by the simulation.  The group definitions in
the mixture will be used to perform collisions between pairs of
groups.

The {file} argument is for a file which contains definitions of VSS
model parameters for some number of species.  It can contain species
not used by this simulation.  All species currently defined by the
simulation must be present in the file.

The format of the file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines are
allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.  All
other lines must have the following format with values separated by
whitespace:

species-ID prop1 prop2 prop3 prop4

The species-ID is a string that will be matched against one of the
species defined by the simulation, via the "species"_species.html
command.  The properties are as follows:

prop1 = diam = diamter of particle (distance units)
prop2 = omega = ???
prop3 = tref = reference temperature (temperature units)
prop4 = alpha = ??? :ul

NOTE: give correct definitions and their units
