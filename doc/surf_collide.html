<H3>surf_collide command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>surf_collide ID style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the surface collision model
style = <I>diffuse</I> 

<LI>args = arguments for that style 

<PRE>  <I>diffuse</I> args = Tsurf acc
    Tsurf = temperature of surface (temperature units)
            Tsurf can be a variable (see below)
    acc = accommodation coefficient

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a style of particle-surface collisions to be performed by DSMC.
One or more styles can be defined and assigned to different surfaces
or simulation box boundaries via the <A HREF = "surface.html">surface</A> or
<A HREF = "bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A> commands.  See the
<A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command for a description of how DSMC
defines surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d
and line segments in 2d.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>diffuse</I> style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.
</P>
<P>The model has 2 parameters set by the <I>Tsurf</I> and <I>acc</I> arguments.
<I>Tsurf</I> is the temperature of the surface.  <I>Acc</I> is an accommodation
coefficient.
</P>
<P>Diffuse reflection is where the particle is emitted from the surface
with no dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is
assigned to the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution
consistent with the surface temperature.  The new velocity will have a
component in the direction of the outward surface normal given by:

<P>and 2 components in the plane tangent to the surface normal
given by:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/diffuse_tangential.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The <I>Twall</I> value can be specified as an equal-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.
</P>
<P>Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.
