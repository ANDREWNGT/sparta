compute grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID grid mix-ID value1 value2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
grid = style name of this compute command :l
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :l
one or more values can be appended :l
value = {n} or {u} or {v} or {w} or {usq} or {vsq} or {wsq} :l
  {n} = molecule count
  {u} = x component of velocity
  {v} = y component of velocity
  {w} = z component of velocity
  {usq} = x component of velocity squared
  {vsq} = y component of velocity squared
  {wsq} = z component of velocity squared
  {ke} = kinetic energy
  {temp} = temperature :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq
compute 1 grid air n u v w :pre

These commands will dump averages for each species and each
grid cell to a file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
dump 1 grid 1000 tmp.grid id f_1 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each grid
cell, based on the molecules in the cell.  The values are summed for
each group of species in the specified mixture.  See the
"mixture"_mixture.html command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.

The results of this compute are used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump grid"_dump.html command.  The values over many timesteps or the
entire simulation can be averaged together by the "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid. command.  In this case, it is as if the
formulas below are sums over both molecules in the grid cell and over
time, with the normalizing factor in the denominator also being summed
over time.

:line

The {n} value counts the number of moleclues in the group.

The {u}, {v}, {w} values compute the average velocity components for
all molecules in the group:

U = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) :pre

The {usq}, {vsq}, {wsq} values compute the average the velocity
component squared for all molecules in the group.

Usq = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) :pre

The {ke} value computes the average kinetic energy for all {N}
molecules in the group:

Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N :pre

The {temp} value also computes the average kinetic energy for all
molecules in the group.  This is converted to a temperature {T} by the
following formula where {kB} is the Boltzmann factor:

Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N
T = KE / (3/2 kB) :pre

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
{n} and {u} values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be {n} and {u} for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be {n} and {u} for the second group, etc.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of SPARTA output
options. 

The per-grid array values will be in the "units"_units.html
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  {U}, {v},
and {w} are in velocity units.  {Usq}, {vsq}, and {wsq} are in
velocity squared units.  {Ke} is in energy units.  {Temp} is in
temperature units.
