13.1 Coming attractions :h4,link(hist_1)

The "Wish list link"_http://dsmc.sandia.gov/future.html on the
SPARTA WWW page gives a list of features we are hoping to add to
SPARTA in the future, including contact names of individuals you can
email if you are interested in contributing to the developement or
would be a future user of that feature.

You can also send "email to the
developers"_http://dsmc.sandia.gov/authors.html if you want to add
your wish to the list.
