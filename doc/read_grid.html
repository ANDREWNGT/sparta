<H3>read_grid command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>read_grid filename 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>filename = name of grid file 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>read_grid grid.sphere 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read in a description of a uniform or hierarchical grid from a file,
which will overlay the simulation domain defined by the
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.  The grid can also be defined by
the <A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>When a uniform or hierarchical grid is defined in a file, it contains
1 or more parent cells, and some number of child cells.  Parent cells
have children; child cells do not.  In the current SPARTA
implementation, all processors own a copy of all parent cells.  The
child cells are each owned by a unique processor; they are assigned by
this command to processors in a round-robin fashion, as they are
created when the file is read.  The <A HREF = "balance_grid.html">balance_grid</A>
command can be used after the grid is defined, to assign them to
processors in a more structured manner.
</P>
<HR>

<P>A grid file contains only a listing of parent cells.  Child cells are
inferred from the parent cell definitions.
</P>
<P>A grid file has a header and a body.  The header appears first.  The
first line of the header is always skipped; it typically contains a
description of the file.  Then lines are read one at a time.  Lines
can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that is ignored.  If the
line is blank (only whitespace after comment is deleted), it is
skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the corresponding
value is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a header keyword,
the line begins the body of the file.
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains one or more sections.  The first line of
a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines in
a section depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or
more blank lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in
any order.
</P>
<P>The formatting of individual lines in the grid file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords must be capitalized as shown and can't have extra
white space between their words.
</P>
<P>These are the recognized header keywords (only one for this file).
Header lines can come in any order.  The value(s) are read from the
beginning of the line.  Thus the keyword <I>parents</I> should be in a line
like "1000 parents".
</P>
<UL><LI><I>parents</I> = # of parent cells in file 
</UL>
<P>These are the recognized section keywords for the body of the file
(only one for this file).
</P>
<UL><LI><I>Parents</I> 
</UL>
<P>The <I>Parents</I> section consists of N consecutive entries, where N = #
of parents, each of this form:
</P>
<PRE>index parent-ID Nx Ny Nz 
</PRE>
<P>The index is ignored; it is only added to assist in examining the
file.  Typically, the indices should run consecutively from 1 to N.
</P>
<P>The parent-ID is a string of numbers (one per level) separated by
dashes, e.g. 12-352-65, where level 1 is the coarsest grid overlaying
the simulation domain, level 2 is the refined grid within a level 1
cell, etc.
</P>
<P>The first number in the ID string is which level 1 cell (from 1 to N1)
this parent cell descends from, the second number is which level 2
cell (from 1 to N2) this parent cell descends from, etc.  The final
number is which cell this cell is within its own parent.
</P>
<P>As an example, consider the parent ID 12-352-65.  Assume the
simulation box was partitioned with a 10x10x10 level 1 grid, or 1000
level 1 grid cells.  These are numbered from 1 to 1000, with x varying
fastest, then y, finally z.  The parent cell with ID 12-352-65 is
inside the 12th of those level 1 cells.  If that cell were sub-divided
into 8x6x10 cells, there would be 480 level 2 cells within the 12th
level 1 cell.  The parent cell with ID 12-352-65 is inside the 352nd
of those level 2 cells.  Likewise it is within the 65th of the level 3
cells inside the 352nd level 2 cell.  Finally, if the entry in the
grid file for this parent cell is
</P>
<PRE>index 12-352-65 2 2 2 
</PRE>
<P>then it means the parent cell is further sub-divided into 2x2x2 level
4 cells, Each of those cells could be a child cell or yet another
parent cell.  The IDs of the 8 new cells will be 12-352-65-1,
12-352-65-2, ..., 12-352-65-8.
</P>
<P>Note that the lines in the <I>Parents</I> section must be ordered such that
no parent cell is listed before its own parent cell appears.  A simple
way to insure this is to list the single level 0 cell first, all level
1 parent cells next, then level 2 parent cells, etc.
</P>
<P>The parent cell with ID = 0 is a special case.  It can be thought of
as the "root" cell, or the single level 0 cell, which represents the
entire simulation domain.  Its specification in the grid file defines
the level 1 grid that overlays the simulation domain.  Thus the first
line of the <I>Parents</I> section should be something like
</P>
<PRE>1 0 10 10 20 
</PRE>
<P>which means the level 1 grid has 10x10x20 cells.
</P>
<P>For 2d simulations, <I>Pz</I> and <I>Cz</I> must both equal 1, for every parent
cell listed in the file.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>In principle, the hierarchical grid used by SPARTA can have as many
levels as you wish.  Internally, each grid cell's location in the
hierarchical grid is converted into a 32-bit integer ID.  At some
point it may become a 64-bit integer ID.  SPARTA will generate an
error if you try to define a grid with too many levels, so that the
internally stored ID overflows.
