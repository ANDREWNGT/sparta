compute ke/molecule command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID ke/molecule :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ke/molecule = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 ke/molecule :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom translational
kinetic energy for each molecule.

The kinetic energy is simply 1/2 m v^2, where m is the mass and v is
the velocity of each molecule.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-molecule vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-molecule values from a compute as input.

The per-molecule vector values will be in energy "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"dump molecule"_dump.html

[Default:] none
