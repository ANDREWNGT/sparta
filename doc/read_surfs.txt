read_surfs command :h3

[Syntax:]

read_surfs id sfile keyword args ... :pre

NOTE: This command is not yet implemented.

id = ID to assign this surf :ulb,l
sfile = name of surface file :l
zero or more keywords :l
keyword = origin or rorigin or translate or scale or orient :l
  origin = x y z
  rorigin = xfrac yfrac zfrac
  translate = dx dy dz
  scale = sx sy sz
  flip
  allowcut
  orient = dim a b c
    dim = x or y or z
    a,b,c = elements of vector :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

read_surfs surf.file

[Description:]

Read the surface grid for one or more objects.  Optionally translate,
scale, orient it.

2d = line segments.

3d = triangles.

Must be watertight, meaning no pair of vertices is within epsilon.
In 2d, also means every vertex is part of 2 line segments.  In 3d,
also means every triangle edge is part of 2 triangles.

:line

Format of surface file

same as data file in LAMMPS, comment and blank lines

what are z values for 2d?

N points (required)
N lines (2d only)
N tris (3d only)
0 10 xlo xhi (required)
0 10 ylo yhi
0 10 zlo zhi (used for 2d?)

Points

id x y z

Lines

p1 p2

Triangles

p1 p2 p3

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the "create_box"_create_box.html command.  And after a grid has been
created by the "create_grid"_create_grid.html command.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
