<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that will be performed on a collection of
particles or grid cells.  Quantities calculated by a compute are
instantaneous values, meaning they are calculated from information
about the current timestep or iteration, though a compute may
internally store some information about a previous state of the
system.  Defining a compute does not perform a computation.  Instead
computes are invoked by other DSMC commands as needed, e.g. to
generate thermodynamic or dump file output.
</P>
<P>The ID of a compute can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.
</P>
<P>Computes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "uncompute.html">uncompute</A> command.
</P>
<P>Code for new computes can be added to DSMC (see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> of the manual) and the results of their
calculations accessed in the various ways described above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Computes calculate one of three styles of quantities: global,
per-particle, or per-grid.  A global quantity is one or more
system-wide values, e.g. the temperature of the system.  A
per-particle quantity is one or more values per particle, e.g. the
kinetic energy of each particle.  A per-grid quantity is one or more
values per grid cell.  Computes that produce per-particle quantities
have the word "particle" in their style, e.g. <I>ke/particle</I>.  Computes
that produce per-grid quantities have the word "particle" in their
style, e.g. <I>ke/cell</I>.  Styles with neither "particle" or "cell" in
their style produce global quantities.
</P>
<P>Note that a single compute produces either global or per-particle or
per-grid quantities, but never more than one of these.
</P>
<P>Global, per-atom, and per-grid quantities each come in three kinds: a
single scalar value, a vector of values, or a 2d array of values.  The
doc page for each compute describes the style and kind of values it
produces, e.g. a per-atom vector.  Some computes produce more than one
kind of a single style, e.g. a global scalar and a global vector.
</P>
<P>When a compute quantity is accessed, as in many of the output commands
discussed below, it can be referenced via the following bracket
notation, where ID is the ID of the compute:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >c_ID </TD><TD > entire scalar, vector, or array</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >c_ID[I] </TD><TD > one element of vector, one column of array</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >c_ID[I][J] </TD><TD > one element of array 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>In other words, using one bracket reduces the dimension of the
quantity once (vector -> scalar, array -> vector).  Using two brackets
reduces the dimension twice (array -> scalar).  Thus a command that
uses scalar compute values as input can also process elements of a
vector or array.
</P>
<P>Note that commands and <A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> which use compute
quantities typically do not allow for all kinds, e.g. a command may
require a vector of values, not a scalar.  This means there is no
ambiguity about referring to a compute quantity as c_ID even if it
produces, for example, both a scalar and vector.  The doc pages for
various commands explain the details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>In DSMC, the values generated by a compute can be used in several
ways:
</P>
<UL><LI>Global values can be output via the <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A>
command.  Or the values can be referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable
equal</A> or <A HREF = "variable.html">variable atom</A> command. 

<LI>Per-particle values can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump particle</A>
command.  Or the per-particle values can be referenced in an
<A HREF = "variable.html">particle-style variable</A>. 

<LI>Per-cell values can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
Or the per-particle values can be referenced in an <A HREF = "variable.html">grid-style
variable</A>. 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>Each compute style has its own doc page which describes its arguments
and what it does.  Here is an alphabetic list of compute styles
available in DSMC:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "compute_temp.html">temp</A> - temperature of all the particles 
</UL>
