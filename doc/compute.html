<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that will be performed on a collection of
particles or grid cells or surface elements.  Quantities calculated by
a compute are instantaneous values, meaning they are calculated from
information about the current timestep or iteration, though a compute
may internally store some information about a previous state of the
system.  Defining a compute does not perform a computation.  Instead
computes are invoked by other SPARTA commands as needed, e.g. to
generate thermodynamic or dump file output.
</P>
<P>The ID of a compute can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.
</P>
<P>Computes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "uncompute.html">uncompute</A> command.
</P>
<P>Code for new computes can be added to SPARTA (see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> of the manual) and the results of their
calculations accessed in the various ways described above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Computes calculate one of four styles of quantities: global,
per-molecule, per-grid, or per-surf.  A global quantity is one or more
system-wide values, e.g. the temperature of the system.  A
per-molecule quantity is one or more values per molecule, e.g. the
kinetic energy of each molecule.  A per-grid quantity is one or more
values per grid cell.  A per-surf quantity is one or more values per
surface element.
</P>
<P>Computes that produce per-molecule quantities have the word "molecule"
in their style name, e.g. <I>ke/molecule</I>.  Computes that produce
per-grid quantities have the word "grid" in their style name,
e.g. <I>ke/grid</I>.  Computes that produce per-surf quantities have the
word "surf" in their style name, e.g. <I>ke/surf</I>.  Styles with neither
"molecule" or "grid" or "surf" in their style nameproduce global
quantities.
</P>
<P>Note that a single compute produces either global or per-molecule or
per-grid or per-surf quantities, but never more than one of these.
</P>
<P>Global, per-molecule, per-grid, and per-surf quantities each come in
three kinds: a single scalar value, a vector of values, or a 2d array
of values.  The doc page for each compute describes the style and kind
of values it produces, e.g. a per-molecule vector.  Some computes
produce more than one kind of a single style, e.g. a global scalar and
a global vector.
</P>
<P>When a compute quantity is accessed, as in many of the output commands
discussed below, it can be referenced via the following bracket
notation, where ID is the ID of the compute:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >c_ID </TD><TD > entire scalar, vector, or array</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >c_ID[I] </TD><TD > one element of vector, one column of array</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >c_ID[I][J] </TD><TD > one element of array 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>In other words, using one bracket reduces the dimension of the
quantity once (vector -> scalar, array -> vector).  Using two brackets
reduces the dimension twice (array -> scalar).  Thus a command that
uses scalar compute values as input can also process elements of a
vector or array.
</P>
<P>Note that commands and <A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> which use compute
quantities typically do not allow for all kinds, e.g. a command may
require a vector of values, not a scalar.  This means there is no
ambiguity about referring to a compute quantity as c_ID even if it
produces, for example, both a scalar and vector.  The doc pages for
various commands explain the details.
</P>

<P>In SPARTA, the values generated by a compute can be used in several
ways:
</P>
<UL><LI>Global values can be output via the <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A>
command.  They can be time-averaged via the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> command.  Or the values can be referenced
in a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable equal</A> or <A HREF = "variable.html">variable atom</A>
command. 

<LI>Per-molecule values can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump particle</A>
command.  They can be reduced to global values via the <A HREF = "doc/compute_reduce.html">compute
reduce</A> command.  Or the per-molecule values
can be referenced in an <A HREF = "variable.html">molecule-style variable</A>. 

<LI>Per-grid values can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
They can be time-averaged via the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A>
command.  They can be reduced to global values via the <A HREF = "doc/compute_reduce.html">compute
reduce</A> command.  Or the per-grid values can
be referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">grid-style variable</A>. 
</UL>
<LI>Per-surf values can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump surf</A> command.
They can be time-averaged via the <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix ave/surf</A>
command.  They can be reduced to global values via the <A HREF = "doc/compute_reduce.html">compute
reduce</A> command.  Or the per-surf values can
be referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">surf-style variable</A>. 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>Each compute style has its own doc page which describes its arguments
and what it does.  Here is an alphabetic list of compute styles
available in SPARTA:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "compute_ke_molecule.html">ke/molecule</A> - temperature of each molecule
<LI><A HREF = "compute_temp.html">temp</A> - temperature of all the molecules 
</UL>
