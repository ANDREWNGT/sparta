<H4>Version info: 
</H4>
<P>The DSMC "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 May
2010. DSMC is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html">this page of
the WWW site</A>.  Each dated copy of DSMC contains all the
features and bug-fixes up to and including that version date. The
version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you run
DSMC. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the DSMC
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages on the DSMC WWW site, they always
describe the most current version of DSMC. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have. 

<LI>The <A HREF = "Manual.pdf">PDF file</A> on the WWW site or in the tarball is updated
about once per month.  This is because it is large, and we don't want
it to be part of very patch. 

<LI>There is also a <A HREF = "Developer.pdf">Developer.pdf</A> file in the doc
directory, which describes the internal structure and algorithms of
DSMC.  
</UL>
<P>DSMC stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.
</P>
<P>DSMC is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>The primary developers of DSMC are <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A>, Aidan
Thompson, and Paul Crozier who can be contacted at
sjplimp,athomps,pscrozi at sandia.gov.  The <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">DSMC WWW Site</A> at
http://lammps.sandia.gov has more information about the code and its
uses.
</P>




<HR>

<P>The DSMC documentation is organized into the following sections.  If
you find errors or omissions in this manual or have suggestions for
useful information to add, please send an email to the developers so
we can improve the DSMC documentation.
</P>
<P>Once you are familiar with DSMC, you may want to bookmark <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#comm">this
page</A> at Section_commands.html#comm since
it gives quick access to documentation for all DSMC commands.
