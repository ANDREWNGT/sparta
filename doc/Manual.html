<H4>Version info: 
</H4>
<P>The SPARTA "version" is the date when it was released, such as 10 Jan
2012. SPARTA is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/bug.html">this page of
the WWW site</A>.  Each dated copy of SPARTA contains all the
features and bug-fixes up to and including that version date. The
version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you run
SPARTA. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the SPARTA
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages on the SPARTA WWW site, they always
describe the most current version of SPARTA. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have. 

<LI>The <A HREF = "Manual.pdf">PDF file</A> on the WWW site or in the tarball is updated
about once per month.  This is because it is large, and we don't want
it to be part of very patch. 

<LI>There is also a <A HREF = "Developer.pdf">Developer.pdf</A> file in the doc
directory, which describes the internal structure and algorithms of
SPARTA. 
</UL>
<P>SPARTA stands for Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas Time-accurate
Analyzer.
</P>
<P>SPARTA is a Direct Simulation Montel Carlo (DSMC) simulator designed
to run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>The primary developers of SPARTA are <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A>, and Michael
Gallis_mg who can be contacted at sjplimp,magalli at sandia.gov.  The
<A HREF = "http://dsmc.sandia.gov">SPARTA WWW Site</A> at http://sparta.sandia.gov has
more information about the code and its uses.

<P>The SPARTA documentation is organized into the following sections.  If
you find errors or omissions in this manual or have suggestions for
useful information to add, please send an email to the developers so
we can improve the SPARTA documentation.
</P>
<P>Once you are familiar with SPARTA, you may want to bookmark <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#comm">this
page</A> at Section_commands.html#comm since
it gives quick access to documentation for all SPARTA commands.
