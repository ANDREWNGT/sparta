<PRE>compute ID sonine/grid mix-ID keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command 

<LI>ke/grid = style name of this compute command 

<LI>mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on 

<LI>one or more keywords may be appended, multiple times 

<LI>keyword = <I>thermal</I> or <I>a</I> or <I>b</I> 

<LI>values = values for specific keyword 

<PRE>  <I>thermal</I> args = none = calculate temperature
  <I>a</I> args = dim order
    dim = <I>x</I> or <I>y</I> or <I>z</I>
    order = number from 1 to 5
  <I>b</I> args = dim2 order
    dim2 = <I>xx</I> or <I>yy</I> or <I>zz</I> or <I>xy</I> or <I>yz</I> or <I>xz</I>
    order = number from 1 to 5

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the sonine moments of the
velocity distribution of the molecules in each grid cell.  The moments
are summed for each group of species in the specified mixture.  See
the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>The <I>thermal</I> keyword computes the thermal temperature for a group of
molecules in the cell.  The contribution of each molecule in the group
to the temperature T is given by
</P>
<PRE>T = 1/2 mass Csq
Csq = VTx*VTx + VTy*VTy + VTz*VTz
VTx = Vx - VAVEx
VTy = Vy - VAVEy
VTz = Vz - VAVEz 
</PRE>
<P>where VAVE xyz are the components of the average velocity of molecules
for that group in that cell.  VT xyz are the components of the thermal
velocity of a molecule, obtained by subtracting off the average
velocity.
</P>
<P>The <I>a</I> keyword calculates one or more sonine A moments for a group of
molecules in the cell.  The contribution of each molecule in the group
to each moment of the 5 moments is given by
</P>
<PRE>A1 = Vdim * pow(Csq,1)
A2 = Vdim * pow(Csq,2)
A3 = Vdim * pow(Csq,3)
A4 = Vdim * pow(Csq,4)
A5 = Vdim * pow(Csq,5) 
</PRE>
<P>where Vdim is Vx or Vy or Vz as specified by the <I>dim</I> value.  The
number of moments computed is specified by the <I>order</I> value.
</P>
<P>The <I>b</I> keyword calculates one or more sonine B moments for a group of
molecules in the cell.  The contribution of each molecule in the group
to each moment of the 5 moments is given by
</P>
<PRE>B1 = Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,1)
B2 = Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,2)
B3 = Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,3)
B4 = Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,4)
B5 = Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,5) 
</PRE>
<P>where Vdim1 is Vx or Vy or Vz, and Vdim2 is also Vx or Vy or Vz, as
specified by the <I>dim2</I> value.  E.g. if <I>dime2</I> is <I>xy</I>, then Vdim1 =
<I>x</I> and Vdim2 = <I>y</I>.  The number of moments computed is specified by
the <I>order</I> value.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>If the mixture has a single group and only a single moment is
specified, then this compute calculates a per-grid vector.  If the
mixture has multiple groups or multiple moments are specified, this
compute calcualtes a per-grid array, with the number of columns equal
to the number of groups times the number of moments per group.  The
ordering of columns is first by moments, then by groups.  I.e. if the
<I>thermal</I> and <I>b xy 2</I> moments were specified as keywords, then the
1st thru 3rd columns would be the <I>thermal</I> and B1 and B2 moments of
the first group, the 4th thru 6th columns would be the <I>thermal</I> and
B1 and B2 moments of the second group, etc.
</P>
<P>Either the vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses
per-grid values from a compute as input.
</P>
<P>The per-grid vector and array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual moments as described above, e.g
temperature units, velocity to the third power, 5th power, etc.
