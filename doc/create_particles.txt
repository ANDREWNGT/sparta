create_particles command :h3

[Syntax:]

create_particles N seed keyword value ... :pre

N = # of particles to create :ulb,l
seed = random # seed (positive integer) :l

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {loop} :l
  {loop} value = {all} or {local} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

create_particles 10000 187483 :pre
create_particles 10000000 49892 loop local :pre

[Description:]

Create or add an additional {N} particles to the simulation domain.

A random number generator, initialized by the specified {seed}, is
used to generate a random position for each particle within
the simulation box.

The particles are initialized with a velocity = 0.0.

The {loop} keyword controls how the particles are generated in parallel.

If the setting is {all}, then every processor loops over all {N} particles.
As the coordinates of each is created, each processor checks what
grid cell it is in, and only stores the particle if it owns that grid cell.
Thus the same set of particles are created, no matter how many processors
are running the simulation

If the setting is {loop}, then each of the {P} processors generates a
{N/P} itself, independent of the other processors, using its own
random number generation.  It only adds particles to grid cells that
it owns.  This is a faster way to generate a large number of particles,
but means that the particles generated depend on the number of
processors used (though not in a statistical sense).

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The option defaults are loop = all.
