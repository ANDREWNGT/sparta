balance_grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

create_grid Nx Ny Nz keyword args ... :pre

NOTE: should add option to specify dx dy dz

Nx,Ny,Nz = size of grid in each dimension :ul

zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {stride} or {clump} or {block} or {random} :l
  {stride} args = xyz or xzy or yxz or yzx or zxy or zyx
  {clump} args = xyz or xzy or yxz or yzx or zxy or zyx
  {block} args = Px Py Pz
    Px,Py,Pz = # of processors in each dimension
  {random} args = none :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

create_grid 10 10 10
create_grid 10 10 10 block 2 * *
create_grid 100 100 1 stride yxz :pre

[Description:]

Overlay a regular {Nx} by {Ny} by {Nz} grid over the simulation
domain defined by the "create_box"_create_box.html command.

For 2d simulations, {Nz} must be set to 1.

The optional {stride} and {clump} and {block} and {random} keywords
determine how grid cells are assigned to processors.  If none are
specified, then the default {block} setting is used, as listed below.

The {stride} keyword means that every Pth cell is assigned to the same
processor, where P is the number of processors.  E.g. if there are 100
cells and 10 processors, then the 1st processor (proc 0) will be
assigned cells 1,11,21, ..., 91.  The 2nd processor (proc 1) will be
assigned cells 2,12,22 ..., 92.  And The 10th processor (proc 9) will
be assigned cells 10,20,30, ..., 100.

The {clump} keyword means that the Pth clump of cells is assigned to
the same processor, where P is the number of processors.  E.g. if
there are N = 100 cells and 10 processors, then the 1st processor
(proc 0) will be assigned cells 1 to 10.  The 2nd processor (proc 1)
will be assigned cells 11 to 20.  And The 10th processor (proc 9) will
be assigned cells 91 to 100.

The argument for {stride} and {clump} determines how the N grid cells
are ordered and is some permutation of {x}, {y}, and {z}.  Each of the
N cells has 3 indices (I,J,K) to describe its location in the 3d grid.
If the stride argument is yxz, then the cells will be ordered from 1
to N with the y dimension (J index) varying fastest, the x dimension
next (I index), and the z dimension slowest (K index).

The {block} keyword maps the P processors to a {Px} by {Py} by {Pz}
logical grid that overlays the actual {Nx} by {Ny} by {Nz} grid.  This
effectively assigns a contiguous 3d sub-block of cells to each
processor.

Any of the {Px}, {Py}, {Pz} parameters can be specified with an
asterisk "*", in which case SPARTA will choose the number of processors
in that dimension.  It will do this based on the size and shape of the
global grid so as to minimize the surface-to-volume ratio of each
processor's sub-block of cells.

The product of Px, Py, Pz must equal P, the total # of processors SPARTA
is running on.  For a 2d simulation, Pz must equal 1. If multiple
partitions are being used then P is the number of processors in this
partition; see "this section"_Section_start.html#start_6 for an
explanation of the -partition command-line switch.

Note that if you run on a large, prime number of processors P, then a
grid such as 1 x P x 1 will be required, which may incur extra
communication costs.

The {random} keyword means that eacn grid cell will be assigned
randomly to one of the processors.  Note that in this case every
processor will typically not be assigned exactly the same number of
cells.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the "create_box"_create_box.html command.
