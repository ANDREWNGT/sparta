<UL><LI>style = <I>none</I> or <I>tce</I> or <I>qk</I> 

<LI>args = arguments for that style

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define chemical reactions to perform when particle-particle collisions
occur.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> style means that no chemistry will be performed, which is
the default.
</P>
<P>For other styles, a file is specified which contains a list of
chemical reactions, with their associated parameters.  The reactions
are read into SPARTA and stored in a list.  Each time a simulation is
run via the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command, the list is scanned.  Only
reactions for which all the reactants and all the products are
currently defined as species-IDs will be active for the simulation.
Thus the file can contain more reactions than are used in a particular
simulation.  See the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command for how species
IDs are defined.
</P>
<P>The reaction models for the various styles and the corresponding input
file format are described below.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>tce</I> style is the ??? model.  
</P>
<P>NOTE: TCE model needs to be described and cited.
</P>
<P>The format of the input file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines
are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.
All other entries must come in 2-line pairs with values separated by
whitespace in the following format
</P>
<PRE>R1 + R2 + ... --> P1 + P2 + ...
type style C1 C2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction.  R1,
R2, ... are one or more reactants, listed as <A HREF = "species.html">species</A>
IDs.  P1, P2, ... are one or more products, also listed as
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> IDs.  The number of allowed reactants and
products depends on the reaction type, as discussed below.  Individual
reactants and products must be separated by whitespace and a "+" sign.
The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be separated
by whitespace and "-->".
</P>
<P>The <I>type</I> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning.  The type determines how many
reactants and products can be specified in the first line.
</P>
<P>D = dissociation = 2 reactants and 3 products
I = ionization = 2 reactants and 2 or 3 products
E = exchange = 2 reactants and 2 products
R = recombination = 3 reactants and ? products : ul
</P>
<P>A dissociation reaction means that R1 dissociates into P1 and P2 when
it collides with R2.  R2 is preserved in the collision, so
R2 = P3 is required.
</P>
<P>An ionization reaction with 2 products is typically a collision
between R1 and R2 that results in a positively charged ion and an
election.  However, SPARTA does not check that this is the case, so
there is no restriction on the species involved in the reaction.
</P>
<P>An ionization reaction with 3 products is typically a collision
between a neutral R1 and an electon R2 which ejects an electron from
the neutral species.  R2 is preserved in the collision, so R2 = P3 is
required.
</P>
<P>An exchange reaction is typically a collision between R1 and R2 that
results in new products P1 and P2.  There is no restriction on the
species involved in the reaction.
</P>
<P>A recombination reaction ...
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning:
</P>
<UL><LI>A = Arrhenius 
</UL>
<P>The style determines how many reaction coefficients are listed as C1,
C2, ..., and how they are interpreted by SPARTA.
</P>
<P>For the A = Arrhenius style, there are 5 coefficients:
</P>
<UL><LI>C1 = 
<LI>C2 = 
<LI>C3 = 
<LI>C4 = 
<LI>C5 = 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>The <I>qk</I> style is the ??? model.  
</P>
<P>NOTE: QK model needs to be described and cited.
</P>
<P>The format of the input file is the same as for the TCE model,
described above.
