collisions command :h3

[Syntax:]

collisions style args :pre

style = {none} or {vss} :ulb,l
args = arguments for that style :l
  none args = none
  vss args = mix-ID :pre
    mix-ID = ID of mixture to use for group definitions
:ule

[Examples:]

collisions none
collisions vss background :pre

[Description:]

Define what style of collisions will be performed by DSMC.  If
collisions are performed, particles are sorted by grid cell every
timestep and the appropriate collision model is invoked on a
per-grid-cell basis.

The {none} style means that no collisions will be performed, i.e. free
molecular flow.

The {vss} style is the Variable Soft Sphere model.  It requires a
mixture ID to be specified which must contain all the species defined
for the simulation.  The group definitions in the mixture will be used
to perform collisions between all pairs of groups.

VSS needs to be described and cited.
