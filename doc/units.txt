units command :h3

[Syntax:]

units style :pre

style = {cgs} or {si} :ul

[Examples:]

units cgs :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the style of units used for a simulation.  It
determines the units of all quantities specified in the input script
and various input files read by DSMC, as well as the units of all
quantities output to the screen, log file, dump files, and other
output files.  Typically, this command is used at the very beginning
of an input script.

For style {cgs}, these are the units:

mass = grams
distance = centimeters
area = cm^2
volume = cm^3
time = seconds
energy = ergs
velocity = centimeters/second
temperature = degrees K :ul

For style {si}, these are the units:

mass = kilograms
distance = meters
area = m^2
volume = m^3
time = seconds
energy = Joules
velocity = meters/second
temperature = degrees K :ul

The units command also sets the timestep size for each style:
distance to default values for each style:

For style {cgs} this is dt = 1.0 sec.
For style {si} this is dt = 1.0 sec. :ul

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used after the simulation box is defined by the
"create_box"_create_box.html command.
