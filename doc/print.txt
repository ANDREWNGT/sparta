print command :h3

[Syntax:]

print str :pre

str = text string to print, which may contain variables :ul

[Examples:]

print "Done with equilibration"
print 'Done with equilibration'
print Temp=$t :pre

compute myTemp temp
variable t equal c_myTemp
print "The system temperature is now $t" :pre

[Description:]

Print a text string to the screen and logfile.  One line of output is
generated.  If the string has white space in it (spaces, tabs, etc),
then you must enclose it in quotes so that it is treated as a single
argument.  If variables are included in the string, they will be
evaluated and their current values printed.

If you want the print command to be executed multiple times (e.g. with
changing variable values), there are 3 options.  First, consider using
the "fix print"_fix_print.html command, which will print a string
periodically during a simulation.  Second, the print command can be
used as an argument to the {every} option of the "run"_run.html
command.  Third, the print command could appear in a section of the
input script that is looped over (see the "jump"_jump.html and
"next"_next.html commands).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The {every} option for the "run"_run.html command has
not yet been implemented.

See the "variable"_variable.html command for a description of {equal}
style variables which are typically the most useful ones to use with
the print command.  Equal-style variables can calculate formulas
involving mathematical operations, global values calculated by a
"compute"_compute.html or "fix"_fix.html, or references to other
"variables"_variable.html.
