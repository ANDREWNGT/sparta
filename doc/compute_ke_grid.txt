compute ke/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID ke/grid mix-ID :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ke/grid = style name of this compute command
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 ke/grid all
compute 1 ke/grid air :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the translational kinetic energy
of the molecules in each grid cell.  The energy is summed for each
group of species in the specified mixture.  See the
"mixture"_mixture.html command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.

The kinetic energy for a group of molecules in a cell is simply the
sum of 1/2 m v^2 over all the molecules both in the cell and the
group, where m is the mass and v is the velocity of each molecule.

[Output info:]

If the mixture has a single group, then this compute calculates a
per-grid vector.  If the mixture has multiple groups, this compute
calcualtes a per-grid array, with the number of columns equal to the
number of groups.  Either can be accessed by any command that uses
per-grid values from a compute as input.

The per-grid vector and array values will be in energy
"units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none
