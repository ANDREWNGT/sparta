compute ke/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID ke/grid :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ke/grid = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 ke/grid :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom translational
kinetic energy of all the molecules in each grid cell.

The kinetic energy for the cell is simply the sum of 1/2 m v^2 over
all the molecules in the cell, where m is the mass and v is the
velocity of each molecule.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-grid values from a compute as input.

The per-grid vector values will be in energy "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"dump grid"_dump.html

[Default:] none
