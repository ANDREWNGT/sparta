<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID ke/grid mix-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>ke/grid = style name of this compute command
<LI>mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the translational kinetic energy
of the molecules in each grid cell.  The energy is summed for each
group of species in the specified mixture.  See the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>The kinetic energy for a group of molecules in a cell is simply the
sum of 1/2 m v^2 over all the molecules both in the cell and the
group, where m is the mass and v is the velocity of each molecule.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>If the mixture has a single group, then this compute calculates a
per-grid vector.  If the mixture has multiple groups, this compute
calcualtes a per-grid array, with the number of columns equal to the
number of groups.  Either can be accessed by any command that uses
per-grid values from a compute as input.

<P>The per-grid vector and array values will be in energy
