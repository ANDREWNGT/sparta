<H3>mixture command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>mixture ID species1 species2 ... keyword args ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-defined name of the mixture 

<LI>species1, species2, ... = one of more species IDs to include in the mixture 

<LI>zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>nrho</I> or <I>frac</I> or <I>vstream</I> or <I>temp</I> 

<PRE>  <I>nrho</I> arg = density
    density = number density of entire mixture (# per length^3 units)
  <I>frac</I> arg = fraction
    fraction = relative number fraction for each of these species (0 to 1)
  <I>vstream</I> args = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = streaming velocity of each of these species (velocity units)
  <I>temp</I> arg = thermal
    thermal = temperature of each of these species (temperature units)

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a gas mixture which can be used via its ID in other commands
such as <A HREF = "create_particles.html">create_particles</A>.  Any number of
mixtures can be defined and used in a simulation.
</P>
<P>A mixture is a collection of one or more particle species as defined
by the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.  The mixture has global
attributes and per-species attributes.  All attributes have default
values if they are not specified explicitly.
</P>
<P>If the mixture command is used multiple times with the same ID, then
any new species are added to the mixture.  Note that keywords which
set per-species attibutes only apply to species in that specific
mixture command.
</P>
<P>The <I>nrho</I> keyword sets the global density of the mixture.  It can be
used in any mixture command to set the number density of the
corresponding mixture.  For 3d simulations the units are #/volume.
For 2d, the units are effectively #/area.
</P>
<P>The <I>frac</I> keyword sets a per-species attribute.  Its <I>fraction</I> value
is the fraction (from 0 to 1 inclusive) of the total mixture number
density that this species will comprise.
</P>
<P>The sum of assigned <I>frac</I> values cannot exceed 1.0.  If all
species are assigned <I>frac</I> values, they must total to 1.0.
</P>
<P>If <I>frac</I> is not explcitly set for one or more species, then the
fraction for the N unset species will be (1 - sum)/N, where sum
is the sum of assigned <I>frac</I> values.
</P>
<P>The <I>vstream</I> keyword sets a per-species attribute.  The streaming
velocity of particles of those species are set to the specified
<I>Vx,Vy,Vz</I> values.
</P>
<P>The <I>temp</I> keyword sets a per-species attribute.  The thermal
temperature of particles of those species is set to the specified
<I>thermal</I> value.  This is a Gaussian velocity distribution superposed
on top of the streaming velocity.

<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>nrho</I> default is the background gas density, as set by the
<A HREF = "global.html">global</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>vstream</I> and <I>temp</I> defaults are also those of the background
gas, as set by the <A HREF = "global.html">global</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>frac</I> default is descibed above.
