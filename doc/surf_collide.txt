surf_collide command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_collide ID style args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the surface collision model
style = {specular} or {diffuse} :ulb,l
args = arguments for that style :l
  {specular} args = none
  {diffuse} args = Tsurf acc
    Tsurf = temperature of surface (temperature units)
            Tsurf can be a variable (see below)
    acc = accommodation coefficient :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_collide 1 specular
surf_collide 1 diffuse 273.15 0.9
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8 :pre

[Description:]

Define a style of particle-surface collisions to be performed by DSMC.
One or more styles can be defined and assigned to different surfaces
or simulation box boundaries via the "surface"_surface.html or
"bound_modify"_bound_modify.html commands.  See the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command for a description of how DSMC
defines surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d
and line segments in 2d.

The {specular} style computes a simple specular reflection model.  It
requires no arguments.  Specular reflection means that a particle
reflects off the surrace element with its incident velocity vector
reversed with respect to the outward normal of the surface element.
The particle's speed is unchanged.

The {diffuse} style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.

The model has 2 parameters set by the {Tsurf} and {acc} arguments.
{Tsurf} is the temperature of the surface.  {Acc} is an accommodation
coefficient.

Diffuse reflection is where the particle is emitted from the surface
with no dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is
assigned to the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution
consistent with the surface temperature.  The new velocity will have a
component in the direction of the outward surface normal given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_normal.jpg)

and 2 components in the plane tangent to the surface normal
given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_tangential.jpg)

The {Twall} value can be specified as an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.
