surf_collide command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_collide ID style args keyword values ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the surface collision model
style = {specular} or {diffuse} :ulb,l
args = arguments for specific style :l
  {specular} args = none
  {diffuse} args = Tsurf acc
    Tsurf = temperature of surface (temperature units)
            Tsurf can be a variable (see below)
    acc = accommodation coefficient :pre
keyword = {translate} or {rotate} :l
values = values for specific keyword :l
  {translate} args = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = translational velocity of surface (velocity units)
  {rotate} args = Pz Py Pz Wx Wy Wz
    Px,Py,Pz = point to rotate surface around (distance units)
    Wx,Wy,Wz = angular velocity of surface around point (radians/time) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_collide 1 specular
surf_collide 1 diffuse 273.15 0.9
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8 translate 5.0 0.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Define a style of particle-surface collisions to be performed by DSMC.
One or more styles can be defined and assigned to different surfaces
or simulation box boundaries via the "surface"_surface.html or
"bound_modify"_bound_modify.html commands.  See the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command for a description of how DSMC
defines surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d
and line segments in 2d.

The {specular} style computes a simple specular reflection model.  It
requires no arguments.  Specular reflection means that a particle
reflects off the surrace element with its incident velocity vector
reversed with respect to the outward normal of the surface element.
The particle's speed is unchanged.

:line

The {diffuse} style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.

The model has 2 parameters set by the {Tsurf} and {acc} arguments.
{Tsurf} is the temperature of the surface.  {Acc} is an accommodation
coefficient.

Diffuse reflection is where the particle is emitted from the surface
with no dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is
assigned to the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution
consistent with the surface temperature.  The new velocity will have a
component in the direction of the outward surface normal given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_normal.jpg)

and 2 components in the plane tangent to the surface normal
given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_tangential.jpg)

The {Twall} value can be specified as an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.

:line

The keyword {translate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.
It models the surface as if it were translating with a constant
velocity, specified by the vector (Vx,Vy,Vz).  This velocity is added
to the final post-collisional velocity of each particle that collides
with the surface.

Note that you should define the velocity vector to be tangential to
the surface.  Normally this keyword should only be used for flat
surfaces, such as the simulation box wall.  DSMC does not check for
these conditions.

:line

The keyword {rotate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.  It
models the surface as if it were rotating with a constant angular
velocity, specified by the vector W = (Wx,Wy,Wz), around the specified
point P = (Px,Py,Pz).  When a particle collides with the surface at a
point X = (x,y,z), the collision point has a velocity given by V =
(Vx,Vy,Vz) = W cross (X-P).  This velocity is added to the final
post-collisional velocity of the particle.

This keyword can be used to model a rotating wall, e.g. the end cap of
a cylinder.  Or to model a rotating object consisting of surface
elements, e.g. a sphere.  In either case, the surface itself does not
move or rotate, e.g. the surface elements do not change position.
They are simply modeled as having a tangential velocity, as if the
entire object were rotating.

[Restrictions:]

The {translate} and {rotate} keywords cannot be used together.
