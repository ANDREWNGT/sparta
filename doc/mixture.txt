mixture command :h3

[Syntax:]

mixture ID species1 species2 ... keyword args ... :pre

ID = user-defined name of the mixture :ulb,l
species1, species2, ... = one of more species IDs to include in the mixture :l

zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {frac} or {nrho} or {vstream} or {temp} :l
  {frac} arg = fraction
    fraction = relative number fraction for each of these species (0 to 1)
  {nrho} arg = density
    density = number density of entire mixture (# per length^3 units)
  {vstream} args = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = streaming velocity of entire mixture (velocity units)
  {temp} arg = thermal
    thermal = temperature of entire mixture (temperature units) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

mixture air N O NO
mixture air N O NO vstream 250.0 0.0 0.0
mixture air N frac 0.8
mixture air O frac 0.2
mixture background N O :pre

[Description:]

Define a gas mixture which can be used via its ID in other commands
such as "create_particles"_create_particles.html.  Any number of
mixtures can be defined and used in a simulation.

The ID of a mixture can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.

A mixture is a collection of one or more particle species as defined
by the "species"_species.html command.  The mixture has global
attributes as well as per-species attributes.  Any of these attributes
can be set by using the mixture command several times for the same ID,
using the desired species.  All attributes have default values if they
are not specified explicitly.

If the mixture command is used with the same ID as a previously
defined mixture, then any new species which appears for the first time
is added to the mixture.  Note that keywords which set per-species
attibutes only apply to the species listed in that command.

The {frac} keyword sets a per-species attribute.  Its {fraction} value
is the fraction (from 0 to 1 inclusive) of the total number density of
the mixture that this species will comprise.

The sum of assigned {frac} values cannot exceed 1.0.  If all
species are assigned {frac} values, they must total to 1.0.

If {frac} is not explcitly set for one or more species, then the
fraction for the N unset species will be (1 - sum)/N, where sum
is the sum of assigned {frac} values.

The {nrho} keyword sets a global attribute, namely the density of the
mixture.  It can be used in any mixture command to set the number
density of the corresponding mixture.  For 3d simulations the units
are #/volume.  For 2d, the units are effectively #/area.

The {vstream} keyword sets a global attribute, namely the streaming
velocity of the mixture.  All particles created using the mixture will
hvae the specified {Vx,Vy,Vz} values.

The {temp} keyword sets a global attribute, namely the thermal
temperature of particles in the mixture, which is set to the specified
{thermal} value.  In terms of particle velocity, this is used to
sample a Gaussian velocity distribution at the requested temperature
which is superposed on top of the streaming velocity when a particle's
velocity is set.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"global"_global.html, "create_particles"_create_particles.html

[Default:]

The {frac} default is described above.

The {nrho}, {vstream}, and {temp} defaults are those defined for the
background gas density, as set by the "global"_global.html command.
