<H3>compute grid command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID grid mix-ID value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command 

<LI>grid = style name of this compute command 

<LI>mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on 

<LI>one or more values may be appended 

<LI>values = <I>n</I> or <I>u</I> or <I>v</I> or <I>w</I> or <I>usq</I> or <I>vsq</I> or <I>wsq</I> 

<PRE>  <I>n</I> = molecule count
  <I>u</I> = x component of velocity
  <I>v</I> = y component of velocity
  <I>w</I> = z component of velocity
  <I>usq</I> = x component of velocity squared
  <I>vsq</I> = y component of velocity squared
  <I>wsq</I> = z component of velocity squared
  <I>ke</I> = kinetic energy

<P>These commands will dump standard per grid cell averages for each
species to a file every 1000 steps:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
dump 1 grid 1000 tmp.grid id f_1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates one or more values for the
molecules in each grid cell.  The values are summed for each group of
species in the specified mixture.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A>
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>Along with summing each specified value, a normalization factor is
also computed.  If the group has a single species, the normalization
factor is typically just the count of contributing molecules.  If the
group has mutlipe species, the normalization factor is typically the
total mass of the contributing molecules.  The normalization factors
are used by other commands that process values produced by this
compute.
</P>
<P>For example, for the <I>u</I> value, the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command,
will generate the average x component of velocity for molecules in a
grid cell, averaged over molecules in the group.  The <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command will generate the average x
component of velocity for molecules in a grid cell, averaged both over
molecules in the group and time.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> value counts the number of moleclues.  There is no
normalization factor associated with it.
</P>
<P>The <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, <I>w</I> values compute the summed velocity components for
all molecules in the group.  If the group has multiple species, the
sum is mass-weighted and the normalization factor is the total mass.
</P>
<PRE>U = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) 
</PRE>
<P>If the group has a single species, no mass weighting is done and the
normalization factor is the count of molecules.
</P>
<P>The <I>usq</I>, <I>vsq</I>, <I>wsq</I> values compute the sum of the velocity
component squared for all molecules in the group.  If the group has
multiple species, the sum is mass-weighted and the normalization
factor is the total mass.
</P>
<PRE>Usq = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i Vx_i) 
</PRE>
<P>If the group has a single species, no mass weighting is done and the
normalization factor is the count of molecules.
</P>
<P>The <I>ke</I> value computes the summed kinetic energy for all molecules in
the group.  The normalization factor is the count of molecules.
</P>
<PRE>KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i)
Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>temp</I> value also computes the summed kinetic energy for all
molecules in the group.  The normalization factor is 3 times the
count of molecules times the Boltzmann factor <I>kB</I>, so that
the sum divided by the normalization factor is the temperature <I>T</I>.
</P>
<PRE>KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i)
Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
3/2 kB T = KE 
</PRE>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
is equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
<I>n</I> and <I>u</I> values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the second group, etc.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  <I>U</I>, <I>v</I>,
and <I>w</I> are in velocity units.  <I>Usq</I>, <I>vsq</I>, and <I>wsq</I> are in
velocity squared units.  <I>Ke</I> is in energy units.  <I>Temp</I> is in
temperature units.
