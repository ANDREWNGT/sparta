<P>These commands will dump averages for each species and each
grid cell to a file every 1000 steps:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq

dump 1 grid 1000 tmp.grid id f_1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each grid
cell, based on the molecules in the cell.  The values are summed for
each group of species in the specified mixture.  See the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute are used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.  The values over many timesteps or the
entire simulation can be averaged together by the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command.  In this case, it is as if the
formulas below are sums over both molecules in the grid cell and over
time, with the normalizing factor in the denominator also being summed
over time.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> value counts the number of moleclues in the group.
</P>
<P>The <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, <I>w</I> values computes the components of the average
velocity for all molecules in the group:
</P>
<PRE>U = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>usq</I>, <I>vsq</I>, <I>wsq</I> values compute the squared component of
the average velocity for all molecules in the group.
</P>
<PRE>Usq = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>ke</I> value computes the average kinetic energy for all <I>N</I>
molecules in the group:
</P>
<PRE>Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>mass</I> value computes the average mass for all <I>N</I> molecules in
the group:
</P>
<PRE>KE = Sum_i (mass_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>temp</I> value first computes the average kinetic energy for all
molecules in the group, as for the <I>ke</I> value.  This is then converted
to a temperature <I>T</I> by the following formula where <I>kB</I> is the
Boltzmann factor:
</P>
<PRE>Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N
T = KE / (3/2 kB) 
</PRE>
<P>Note that this definition of temperature does not subtract out a net
streaming velocity for molecules in the grid cell, so it is not a
thermal temperature in a streaming context.  See the <A HREF = "compute_???_grid.html">compute
???/grid</A> command for calculating thermal
temperatures in the presence of streaming.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
<I>n</I> and <I>u</I> values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the second group, etc.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of SPARTA output
options. 
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  <I>U</I>, <I>v</I>,
and <I>w</I> are in velocity units.  <I>Usq</I>, <I>vsq</I>, and <I>wsq</I> are in
velocity squared units.  <I>Ke</I> is in energy units.  <I>Mass</I> is in mass
units. <I>Temp</I> is in temperature units.
