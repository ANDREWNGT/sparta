global command :h3

[Syntax:]

global keyword values ... :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs :ulb,l
keyword = {fnum} or {nrho} or {vstream} or {temp} or {gravity} or {surfmax} :l
  {fnum} value = ratio
    ratio = Fnum ratio of physical particles to simulation particles
  {nrho} value = density
    density = number density of background gas (# per length^3 units)
  {vstream} values = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = streaming velocity of background gas (velocity units)
  {temp} values = thermal
    thermal = temperature of background gas (temperature units)
  {gravity} values = acc
    acc = acceleration due to gravity (acceleration units)
  {surfmax} value = Nsurf
    Nsurf = max # of surface elements allowed in single grid cell :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

background fnum 1.0e20
background vstream 100.0 0 0
background temp 1000 :pre

[Description:]

Define global properties of the system.

The {fnum} keyword sets the ratio of real, physical particles
(i.e. molecules) to simulation particles.

The {nrho} keyword sets the number density of the background gas.
For 3d simulations the units are #/volume.  For 2d, the units are
effectively #/area.

Assuming your simulation is populated by particles from the
background gas, the {fnum} and {nrho} settings determine
how many particles will be present in your simulation.

The {vstream} keyword sets the streaming velocity of the background
gas.

The {temp} keyword sets the thermal temperature of the background gas.
This is a Gaussian velocity distribution superposed
on top of the streaming velocity.

The {gravity} keyword sets an acceleration term which is included in
the motion of particles.  A positive value acts in the downward
direction, i.e. -z for 3d, -y for 2d.  If the value is set to 0.0, no
acceleration term is included, which is the default.

The {surfmax} keyword determines the maximum number of surface
elements (lines in 2d, triangles in 3d) can overlap a single grid
cell.  The default is 100, which should be large enough for most
simulations, unless you define very coarse grid cells (relative to the
size of surface elements).  

[Restrictions:]

The global surfmax command must be used before surface elements are
defined, e.g. via the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command.

[Related commands:]

"mixture"_mixture.html

[Default:]

The keyword defaults are fnum = 1.0, nrho = 1.0, vstream = 0.0 0.0
0.0, temp = 273.15, gravity = 0.0, surfmax = 100.
