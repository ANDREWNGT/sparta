global command :h3

[Syntax:]

global keyword values :pre

keyword = {fnum} or {nrho} or {vstream} or {temp} :ulb,l
  {fnum} value = ratio
    ratio = Fnum ratio of physical particles to simulation particles
  {nrho} value = density
    density = number density of background gas (# per length^3 units)
  {vstream} values = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = streaming velocity of background gas (velocity units)
  {temp} values = thermal
    thermal = temperature of background gas (temperature units) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

background fnum 1.0e20
background vstream 100.0 0 0
background temp 1000 :pre

[Description:]

Define global properties of the system.

The {fnum} keyword sets the ratio of real, physical particles
(i.e. molecules) to simulation particles.

The {nrho} keyword sets the number density of the background gas.
For 3d simulations the units are #/volume.  For 2d, the units are
effectively #/area.

Assuming your simulation is populated by particles from the
background gas, the {fnum} and {nrho} settings determine
how many particles will be present in your simulation.

The {vstream} keyword sets the streaming velocity of the background
gas.

The {temp} keyword sets the thermal temperature of the background gas.
This is a Gaussian velocity distribution superposed
on top of the streaming velocity.

[Restrictions:] none

The keyword defaults are fnum = 1.0, nrho = 1.0, vstream = 0.0 0.0
0.0, temp = 300.
