bound_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

bound_modify wall keyword value ... :pre

wall = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :ulb,l
one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :l
keywords = {surf}
  {surf} value = surface collision ID
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

bound_modify yhi surf 1
bound_modify zlo surf hotwall :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for one of the boundaries of the global simulation box.

Any of the 6 faces can be selected via the {wall} setting.

The {surf} keyword can only be used when the boundary is of type "s",
for surface, as set by the "boundary"_boundary.html command.  This
keyword assigns a surface collision model to the boundary, as defined
by the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.  When that command is
used, a surface collision ID is defined, which is specified with this
command as {sc-ID}.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with this
boundary will be computed by the specified surface collision model.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"boundary"_boundary.html

[Default:] none
