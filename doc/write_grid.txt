write_grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

write_grid file :pre

file = name of file to write grid info to :ul

[Examples:]

write_grid data.grid :pre

[Description:]

Write a grid file in text format that lists all the parent cells in
the currently defined hierarchical grid.  See the
"read_grid"_read_grid.html and "create_grid"_create_grid.html commands
for a definition of hierarchical grids and parent/child cells as used
by SPARTA.

The output file is in the same format as the input file used by the
"read_grid"_read_grid.html" command.  Thus the file can be used to
start a subsequent simulation using the same grid topology.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"read_grid"_read_grid.html, "create_grid"_create_grid.html

[Default:] none
