<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the content of statistical data printed to the screen and log
file.
</P>
<P>The values printed by the various keywords are instantaneous values,
calculated on the current timestep.
</P>
<P>Options invoked by the <A HREF = "stats_modify.html">stats_modify</A> command can
be used to set the numeric precision of each printed value, as well as
other attributes of the statistics.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>step</I> and <I>elapsed</I> keywords refer to timestep count.  <I>Step</I> is
the current timestep, or iteration count when a
<A HREF = "minimize.html">minimization</A> is being performed.  <I>Elapsed</I> is the
number of timesteps elapsed since the beginning of this run.
</P>
<P>The <I>cpu</I> keyword is elapsed CPU seconds since the beginning of this
run.  The <I>tpcpu</I> and <I>spcpu</I> keywords are measures of how fast your
simulation is currently running.  The <I>tpcpu</I> keyword is simulation
time per CPU second, where simulation time is in time
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The <I>spcpu</I> keyword is the number of timesteps
per CPU second.  Both quantities are on-the-fly metrics, measured
relative to the last time they were invoked.  Thus if you are printing
out statistical output every 100 timesteps, the two keywords will
continually output the time and timestep rate for the last 100 steps.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>nmol</I> keyword is the current number of molecules.
</P>
<P>The <I>ncoll</I> keyword is the number of collisions that occured
on the current timestep.
</P>
<P>The <I>nattempt</I> keyword is the number of attempted collisions that
occurred on the current timestep.
</P>
<P>The <I>vol</I> keyword is the volume (or area in 2d) of the simulation box.
</P>
<P>The <I>lx</I>, <I>ly</I>, <I>lz</I> keywords are the dimensions of the simulation
box.
</P>
<P>The <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>, <I>zhi</I> keywords are the
boundaries of the simulation box.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[I]</I> and <I>c_ID[I][J]</I> keywords allow global
values calculated by a compute to be output.  As discussed on the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> doc page, computes can calculate global,
per-molecule, or per-grid values.  Only global values can be
referenced by this command.  However, per-molecule or per-grid compute
values can be referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> and the
variable referenced, as discussed below.
</P>
<P>The ID in the keyword should be replaced by the actual ID of a compute
that has been defined elsewhere in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.  If the compute calculates
a global scalar, vector, or array, then the keyword formats with 0, 1,
or 2 brackets will reference a scalar value from the compute.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[I]</I> and <I>f_ID[I][J]</I> keywords allow global
values calculated by a fix to be output.  As discussed on the
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> doc page, fixes can calculate global, per-molecule, or
per-grid values.  Only global values can be referenced by this
command.  However, per-molecule or per-grid fix values can be
referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> and the variable referenced,
as discussed below.
</P>
<P>The ID in the keyword should be replaced by the actual ID of a fix
that has been defined elsewhere in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command for details.  If the fix calculates a global
scalar, vector, or array, then the keyword formats with 0, 1, or 2
brackets will reference a scalar value from the fix.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> keyword allow the current value of a variable to be
output.  The name in the keyword should be replaced by the variable
name that has been defined elsewhere in the input script.  Only
equal-style variables can be referenced.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for details.  Variables of style
<I>equal</I> can reference per-molecule or per-grid properties or stats
keywords, or they can invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when
evaluated, so this is a very general means of creating statistical
output.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">Section_modify</A> for information on how to add
new compute and fix styles to DSMC to calculate quantities that can
then be referenced with these keywords to generate statistical output.
