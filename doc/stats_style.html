<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the content of statistical data printed to the screen and log
file.
</P>
<P>The values printed by the various keywords are instantaneous values,
calculated on the current timestep.
</P>
<P>Options invoked by the <A HREF = "thermo_modify.html">stats_modify</A> command can
be used to set the numeric precision of each printed value, as well as
other attributes of the statistics.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>step</I> and <I>elapsed</I> keywords refer to timestep count.  <I>Step</I> is
the current timestep, or iteration count when a
<A HREF = "minimize.html">minimization</A> is being performed.  <I>Elapsed</I> is the
number of timesteps elapsed since the beginning of this run.
</P>
<P>The <I>cpu</I> keyword is elapsed CPU seconds since the beginning of this
run.  The <I>tpcpu</I> and <I>spcpu</I> keywords are measures of how fast your
simulation is currently running.  The <I>tpcpu</I> keyword is simulation
time per CPU second, where simulation time is in time
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The <I>spcpu</I> keyword is the number of timesteps
per CPU second.  Both quantities are on-the-fly metrics, measured
relative to the last time they were invoked.  Thus if you are printing
out statistical output every 100 timesteps, the two keywords will
continually output the time and timestep rate for the last 100 steps.
