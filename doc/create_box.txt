create_box command :h3

[Syntax:]

create_box xlo xhi ylo yhi zlo zhi :pre

xlo,xhi = box bounds in the x dimension (distance units)
ylo,yhi = box bounds in the y dimension (distance units)
zlo,zhi = box bounds in the z dimension (distance units) :pre

[Examples:]

create_box 0 1 0 1 0 1
create_box 0 1 0 1 -0.5 0.5
create_box 0 10.0 0 5.0 -4.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set the size of the simulation box.

For a 2d simulation, as specifed by the "dimension"_dimension.html
command, {zlo} < 0.0 and {zhi} > 0.0 is required.  This is so that the
z dimensions straddle 0.0.

[Restrictions:]

For 2d axi-symmetric simulations, as set by the
"dimension"_dimension.html and "boundary"_boundary.html commands, the
ylo setting must be 0.0.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
