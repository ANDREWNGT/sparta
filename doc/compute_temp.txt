compute temp command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID temp :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 temp
compute myTemp temp :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the temperature of all particles.

The temperature is calculated by the formula KE = dim/2 N kB T, where
KE = total kinetic energy of the particles (sum of 1/2 m v^2), dim =
dimensionality of the simulation, N = number of particles, kB =
Boltzmann constant, and T = temperature.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature).  This value
can be used by any command that uses global scalar values from a
compute as input.  See "this section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for
an overview of DSMC output options.

The scalar value will be in temperature "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
