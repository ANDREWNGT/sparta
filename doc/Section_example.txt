5. Example problems :h3

The SPARTA distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  Most are 2d models so that they run quickly, requiring at most a
couple of minutes to run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an
input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*) and dump file
(dump.*) when it runs.  Some use a data file (data.*) of initial
coordinates as additional input.  A few sample log file outputs on
different machines and different numbers of processors are included in
the directories to compare your answers to.  E.g. a log file like
log.crack.foo.P means it ran on P processors of machine "foo".

The dump files produced by the example runs can be animated using the
xmovie tool described in the "Additional Tools"_Section_tools.html
section of the SPARTA documentation.  Animations of many of these
examples can be viewed on the Movies section of the "SPARTA WWW
Site"_sws.

These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

colloid:  big colloid particles in a small particle solvent, 2d system
srd:      stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) particles as solvent :tb(s=:)

Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:

cd indent
cp ../../src/lmp_linux .           # copy SPARTA executable to this dir
lmp_linux < in.indent              # run the problem :pre

Running the simulation produces the files {dump.indent} and
{log.lammps}.  You can visualize the dump file as follows:

../../tools/xmovie/xmovie -scale dump.indent :pre

There is also a COUPLE directory with examples of how to use SPARTA as
a library, either by itself or in tandem with another code or library.
See the COUPLE/README file to get started.
