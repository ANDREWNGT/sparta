boundary command :h3

[Syntax:]

boundary x y z :pre

x,y,z = {o} or {p} or {s} or {d}, one or two letters :ulb,l
  {o} is outflow
  {p} is periodic
  {s} is specular reflection
  {d} is diffuse reflection :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

boundary o p 
boundary o so
boundary s p s :pre

[Description:]

Set the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each of
the x, y, z dimensions.  A single letter assigns the same style to
both the lower and upper face of the box.  Two letters assigns the
first style to the lower face and the second style to the upper face.
The size of the simulation box is set by the
"create_box"_create_box.html command.

The boundary style determines how particles exiting the box
are handled.

Style {o} means an outflow boundary, so that particles freely exit
the simulation.

Style {p} means the box is periodic, so that particles exit one
end of the box and re-enter the other end.  The {p} style must be
applied to both faces of a dimension.

Style {s} means a specularly reflecting boundary.  Particles that
cross this boundary have their velocity reversed so as to re-enter the
box.  The new velocity is used to advect the particle for the reminder
of the timestep following the collision.

Style {d} means a diffuse reflecting boundary.  Two additional
parameters are defined for each such boundary:

acc = accomodation coefficient
Twall = temperature of wall (temperature units)

These parameters have default values of acc = 1.0 and Twall = 273.15K.
They can be set to different values for an individual wall by the
"bound_modify"_bound_modify.html command.

The accomodation coefficient is a fractional value from 0.0 to 1.0.
Each time a particle collides with the wall a random number RN is generated.
If RN > acc, then specular reflection occurs, as described above.
If RN <= acc, then diffuse relection occurs, using the following
equation to reset the velocity of the particle, consistent with
a thermal velocity equal to the wall temperature Twall:

NOTE: eqs for diffuse reflection need to be added

Note that the new velocity is always directed back into the
simulatoion box.  The new velocity is used to advect the particle for
the reminder of the timestep following the collision.

[Restrictions:]

For 2d simulations, the z dimension must be periodic.
