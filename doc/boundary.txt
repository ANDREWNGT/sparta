boundary command :h3

[Syntax:]

boundary x y z :pre

x,y,z = {o} or {p} or {s}, one or two letters :ulb,l
  {o} is outflow
  {p} is periodic
  {s} is specular reflection :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

boundary o p 
boundary o so
boundary s p s :pre

[Description:]

Set the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each of
the x, y, z dimensions.  A single letter assigns the same style to
both the lower and upper face of the box.  Two letters assigns the
first style to the lower face and the second style to the upper face.
The size of the simulation box is set by the
"create_box"_create_box.html command.

The boundary style determines how particles exiting the box
are handled.

The style {o} means an outflow boundary, so that particles freely exit
the simulation.

The style {p} means the box is periodic, so that particles exit one
end of the box and re-enter the other end.  The {p} style must be
applied to both faces of a dimension.

The styles {s} means a specularly reflecting boundary.  Particles that
cross this boundary have their velocity reversed and re-enter the box.

[Restrictions:] none

For 2d simulations, the z dimension must be periodic.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

boundary p p p :pre
